These are instructions for setting up Circle Blvd on an Amazon EC2 instance running Ubuntu, or really any Ubuntu server you are happy with. 

It assumes the default user account is 'ubuntu' (created by the AMI).

Directions:

0. Create an EC2 instance using Amazon Web Services

--> ssh into it with your key pair
1. Copy circle-blvd.conf to /etc/init/circle-blvd.conf
2. Copy setup.sh to ~/setup.sh
3. sh ./setup.sh
4. Agree to some things.
5. sudo start circle-blvd

5. That's it!
