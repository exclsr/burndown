            p Thank you for considering becoming a sponsor.

            p The goal of <a href="http://holmwell.com">Holmwell Software</a> and 
             | Circle Blvd is to provide the best organizational tools available to 
             | small groups who might not have a six-figure budget. In turn, organizations
             | can focus on making our towns and cities better places to live. 

            p To achieve this goal, all of our work is available to the public free of charge, and 
             | this is made possible through your generous sponsorship.
