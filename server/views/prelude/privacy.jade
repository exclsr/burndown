            <p>Below is our privacy policy. We copied most of it from <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic Inc</a>. They're good people, and help make the Web a better place. This policy is available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license.</p>

            <p>We use <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>'s services for transaction processing, and <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> for visitor information, as described below.</p>

            <p>Holmwell Software LLC (“<strong>Holmwell Software</strong>”) operates several websites including <a href="https://circleblvd.org/">circleblvd.org</a> and <a href="http://holmwell.com/">holmwell.com</a>. It is Holmwell Software’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

            <h3>Website Visitors</h3>

            <p>Like most website operators, Holmwell Software collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Holmwell Software&#8217;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Holmwell Software&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Holmwell Software may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

            <p>Holmwell Software also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users<!-- and for users leaving comments on WordPress.com blogs -->. <!-- Holmwell Software only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left. --></p>

            <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>Certain visitors to Holmwell Software’s websites choose to interact with Holmwell Software in ways that require Holmwell Software to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Holmwell Software gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at <a href="https://circleblvd.org/">CircleBlvd.org</a> to provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Holmwell Software – by donating to Circle Blvd., for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Holmwell Software collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Holmwell Software. Holmwell Software does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

            <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
            <p>Holmwell Software may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Holmwell Software may monitor the most popular pages on the CircleBlvd.org site<!--  or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam -->. Holmwell Software may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Holmwell Software does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Holmwell Software’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Holmwell Software discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Holmwell Software believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Holmwell Software, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Holmwell Software website and have supplied your email address, Holmwell Software may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Holmwell Software and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Holmwell Software takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

            <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
            <p>If Holmwell Software, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Holmwell Software goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.

This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Holmwell Software and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

            <!-- <h3>Comments</h3>
