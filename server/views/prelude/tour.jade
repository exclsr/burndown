                h2 Tour: Getting started

                p.before-video.
                    Welcome to Circle Blvd, a really nice todo list, for 
                    groups. It works for individuals, too, but it was made with groups 
                    of up to 12 people in mind.

                            Circle Blvd is all about managing your group's task list, so that's
                            where we'll start.

                            Below is an example list with five items in it, outlining
                            a hypothetical road trip. The list is interactive, meaning it
                            will react the same way as a list in a real account.

                                actively focusing on. Typically, these tasks are expected to be finished

                    p.
                        Circle Blvd helps you prioritize tasks by dragging and dropping them
                        with your mouse. Move tasks up and down by dragging (clicking and holding) the 
                        <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-move"></i> icon, 
                        on the right side.

                    p All the tasks can be moved &ndash; we just use that square 
                     | placeholder to make the list easier on the eyes.

                    h3 Mileposts
                    p The last task in the above list is a <a href="/tour/work/mileposts">milepost</a>.
                     | Use them to prioritize tasks relative to due dates or special events. They're covered in more
                     | detail later in the tour.

                    h3.first Expectations
                    p First, we feel it is important to understand the dynamics behind 
                     | small-team behavior. If your team is composed of part-time volunteers, 
                     | they probably won't use Circle Blvd often. This can be frustrating if it's not
                     | expected. 

                    p We want you to know that's ok, and we have your back. We designed Circle Blvd 
                     | to help you keep track of your entire team's tasks, not just your own. 

                    h3 Adding team members
                    p Project creators can add team members using the admin page. We'll
                     | email invitations to your team, or give you invitation links if you'd
                     | prefer to contact them another way.

                    h3 Assigning tasks
                    p Each task in Circle Blvd has an optional owner, and assignments can be made 
                     | in the standard <a href="/tour/work">detail view</a>. Assignments can
                     | also be made during task
                     | entry, using the @ symbol at the end of the line &ndash;  
                     | for example, "Pick up milk from the store @Phil" will assign this task to Phil.

                    h3 Filtering tasks
                    p Use <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-record"></i> to show only your tasks. 
                     | Clicking on a task's owner name will filter your list, showing only tasks owned
                     | by that person. By the way, you can assign tasks to anyone, including people
                     | without Circle Blvd accounts, and filter on those owners as well.

                    h3 Bulk actions
                    p Select multiple tasks at once with the mouse and use <a href="/tips">keyboard shortcuts</a>
                     | to quickly keep tasks up to date.

                    p Our iPhone app is best for
                     | quick status updates, adding small tasks on the go, and 
                     | remembering your personal assignments.
