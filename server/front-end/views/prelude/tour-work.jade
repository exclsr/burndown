                    commented on this particular task.</p>

                    <p>Quick, back-and-forth converations aren't really a focus of Circle
                    Blvd, since there are so many other websites or apps (or texting) for that sort of thing these days. A search for "group chat" on your favorite search engine will show a few options that might compliment
                    your use of Circle Blvd.</p>

                    <p>We suggest using comments to ask the task creator clarifying questions, or to post decisions that have been made about a task.</p>

                    <p class="below-video">You may have noticed the question mark next to the task owner's name. At Circle Blvd, just because you typed someone's name into a box, that doesn't mean a task is going to be done by that person.</p>

                    <p>If you want, use the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></i> 
                    icon to send a short "please look at this" email to the potential owner. 
                    This icon was created, as a courtesy, for those times when someone asks you to remind him or her to do something.</p> 

                    <p>We suggest using this icon while you're having a conversation with the teammate. People can decide what email address they want to use to receive these notifications.</p>
