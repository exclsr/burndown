                        p Circle Blvd is flexible and works in a lot of
                         | different situations. We've found that successful
                         | teams have a number of things in common, so here
                         | are some guidelines. Please follow them as you
                         | see fit.

                        p Use and update Circle Blvd during this meeting,

                         | This allows people to easily find
                         | the tasks they recently completed.

                        p After you meet with your team, archive your

                        p Circle Blvd is great for planning, but 
                         | don't use it for everything. 

                        p Talk, email, use Slack, text, or whatever,
                         | and communicate how you see fit.
                         | Circle Blvd will be there when you need
                         | to plan again.

                        p Most teams have a leader or two they rally
                         | around. Circle Blvd makes it easier for these
                         | leaders to take action, make decisions, and 
                         | stay on top of things.

                        p If that leader is you, don't expect your team
                         | to use Circle Blvd the same way as you do. You'll
                         | use it a lot more, and that's ok.
