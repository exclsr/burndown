            <p>Thank you for considering a donation to Circle Blvd. </p>
            
            <h3>Where your donation goes</h3>
            <p>Circle Blvd is being created by <a href="http://holmwell.com">Holmwell 
            Software</a>, a company based in Corvallis, Oregon, focused on the needs of small, volunteer-run organizations.</p>

            <p>Holmwell is led by <a href="http://pmnjk.com">Phil Manijak</a>, a co-founder of the <a href="http://corvallisswing.com">Corvallis Swing Dance Society</a> and journeyman computer programmer.

            <p>Your donation will help us keep the lights on until word gets out about our great website. We rent our computers from Amazon; they are the recipient of all our operational fees. A small processing fee, included in your
            donation, will go to&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>.</p>

            <p>Our work would not be possible without the support of other free software projects,
            including <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">Apache CouchDB</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, and <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>.</p>

            <p>Thank you.</p>
